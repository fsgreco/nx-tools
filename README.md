# NxTools

This package contains an Nx generator that aims to help the frontend developing process by generating and scaffolding boilerplate.

At the moment it contains only one generator called `new-component`.  
It scaffolds a React Typescript component and let you choose if setting up a story file for Storybook, as well as a `.spec` file for testing. 

NOTE: at the moment of writing this is in early stages and the generated files are particularly opinionated.
